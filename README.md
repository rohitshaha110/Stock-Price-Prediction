# Stock-Price-Prediction

This is a web-based machine learning application for stock price prediction using Python, Streamlit, and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The application allows users to input a stock ticker, and the LSTM model automatically generates future stock price predictions.

## Features

- Interactive web interface for stock price prediction based on user-provided stock ticker.
- LSTM model for accurate stock price forecasting.
- Simple and user-friendly input field for users to enter the stock ticker for prediction.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies

2. Launch the web application by running:
streamlit run app.py

4. Enter a stock ticker and view the future stock price predictions.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application code.
- `Keras_model.h5`: LSTM model used for stock price prediction.
- `LSTM Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook used for training and optimizing the LSTM model.
